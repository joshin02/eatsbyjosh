      intro: "This is by far the dish I am most proud of so far. It’s honestly such a simple dish but through multiple iterations, I’ve been able to elevate it just a tiny bit each time. At its  foundation, this is simply steak on top of rice seasoned in a soy based sauce. But don’t let the simplicity fool you! In order to eat this at it’s full potential, there’s so many elements you have to make separately and bring together at the end. But I promise you the work is definitely worth it. I’ve probably spent 1-2 years experimenting on this dish and I probably will make another version in the future but for now, I’m super excited to share my experience cooking this dish. Keep reading for entertainment or go and check the recipe out!",

      body: "I think the first time I made this dish, it was probably midnight and I just really wanted to eat whatever I could find in my fridge. I got some left over rice, stir fried some onions, sliced some leftover steak, and drizzled some Bachan’s Japanese bbq sauce and called it good. And if I’m being honest, it’s probably how I would make it most days. But if you got the time to cook and want to treat yourself, your friends, or family to something yummy; I fully recommend taking the extra steps to make this dish next level.",
      keynote1: "Steak: Any cut of meat will do, but make sure it’s at least an inch thick so you have room to get a good sear on all sides without overcooking the middle. Unless you like well cooked meat, in which case, you should just buy the cheapest piece of meat you can find (jk, eat it however you like it’s your food lol).",
      keynote2:"Egg yolk: This is totally optional but I think it adds a nice creamy texture and gives the dish more color. You can just use a plain egg yolk or if you’re feeling fancy, place the egg yolk in shoyu and let it cure overnight.",
      keynote3:"onions: low and slow is key! If you want that natural sweet flavor from the onions and get that golden color, you’re going to need to be patient. Cooking at too high of a heat will cause the onions to burn and dry out. Just cook at a low-medium heat and constantly stir so the onions cook evenly.",
      keynote4:"Shoyu sauce: Bachan’s bbq sauce is a fool proof sauce to make this dish taste good. But if you have the time and want to make everything from scratch, boil some soy, mirin, sugar, bonito flakes, and torched kombu. Let it cool and you got yourself a tare sauce that’ll elevate the dish. (you can use this to cure your yolks too!)",
      keynote5:"Scallions/onions: Less is more and simple does the trick in most cases. But I found this to be a very simple and light topping that brings the dish together. Soak some scallions and diced onions in ice water to get rid of some of the raw spiciness, drain and then put some wasabi, yuzu, and sesame oil and sprinkle it on top!",
      conclusion: "This is something I can probably eat 3-5 times a week easily and it’s so easy to make. And so many shortcuts you can take without compromising flavor if you’re short on time. And if you have the time, these steps just take it up another notch. If there’s any dish on this site you should try making it’s this one! So what are you waiting for? Go to the recipe and try it out yourself :)",
