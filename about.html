          <p>
            Welcome to eats by Josh! I created this site to documentand highlight all the different foods I cook and eat. I’m a self-taught cook learning from watching youtube, 
             tiktoks, ig reels, and watching my 엄마 (mom) cook from afar LOL. I’m going to be as transparent as I can on this site, showing the highlights but also lowlights in my 
             culinary journey! Thanks for checking out the site and if you ever decide to try making any of the recipes here, I would be super appreciative if you tagged me 
             <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eatsby.josh/" class="igmention">@eatsbyjosh</a>
             on ig!

            <p>
              This is where I will highlight my current favorite dishes. I’ll also have all my most recent eats here as well. These posts will be more of an 
              experience blog where I note where the inspo for the dish came from, highlights from cookings, lowlights or things I would change next time, and 
              any other bloopers or notes!

              Once I have tried making a dish a few times and feel it’s ready to share, the full list of ingredients, process, and key tips will be posted here! 
              Make sure to check often to see when recipes get posted but also feel free to contact me if a recipe for a dish will be made available.

              Honestly the best feature for indecisive people like me LOL. This will send you to a random recipe for you to try out for your next meal. If you’re like me, 
              this will save you so much time scrolling or trying to think of something to cook and eat. And hopefully the recipes I post will be worth trying out hehe!

              Only thing I like more than cooking is probably eating! IF cooking is not your thing, don’t worry, I got something for you too. This is where I’ll post reviews 
              for any place I eat out at, ranging from $ to $$$.
